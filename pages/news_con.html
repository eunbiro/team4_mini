            Rihanna – the global icon, designer, entrepreneur, philanthropist,
            and the top-selling digital singles artist of all time – makes her
            highly-anticipated return to music with “Lift Me Up,” the lead
            single from the upcoming
            <i>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</i> original soundtrack.

            “Lift Me Up” was written as a tribute to the extraordinary life and
            legacy of Chadwick Boseman by Tems, Oscar winner Ludwig Göransson,
            Rihanna, and Ryan Coogler. The song was recorded in five countries
            and was produced by Göransson.

            “After speaking with Ryan and hearing his direction for the film and
            the song, I wanted to write something that portrays a warm embrace
            from all the people that I’ve lost in my life. I tried to imagine
            what it would feel like if I could sing to them now and express how
            much I miss them,” said Tems. “Rihanna has been an inspiration to me
            so hearing her convey this song is a great honor.”
