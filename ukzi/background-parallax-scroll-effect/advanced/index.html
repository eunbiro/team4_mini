    <h3>The New World With Iron Man Flying Up</h3>
    <p>It was Kevin Pieggy who played a crucial role in the birth of Marvel's movie franchise. Pi-gi, who participated as an assistant producer in the production of the X-Men live-action movie series, became a fan of Marvel as he explored the original Comics to understand the X-Men franchise properly. Piagy said the original comic has all the answers, suggesting that the movie X-Men's story should focus on the conflict between the mutants trying to save humanity and the mutants trying to dominate like the original. As a result, the X-Men were a huge success, earning $424 million worldwide.

      Impressed by X-Men's performance, Marvel put the weight on Piaget. At that time, Marvel pushed for its own filmmaking plan with Captain America and Nick Fury's filmmaking rights as collateral, judging that it needed a filmmaking project that could be entirely controlled. Pagi was appointed head of Marvel Studios and led the project. PaiGi revamped the basics of Marvel's new filmmaking project. He thought Marvel's true assets were not individual movies, but numerous characters accumulated over a long period of time. Marvel's Comics already had enough characters and stories full of individuality. Movies should be faithful to showing the contents of Comics as a medium of movies that have more impact than comic books. Therefore, Marvel's new films had to be carefully planned and commercialized by Marvel Studios based on a thorough understanding of the original rather than entrusting it to an external producer.</p>
