                    <h1>Phase 2: A solid MCU, the development and conflict of events</h1>
                    <p>As the Avengers successfully wrapped up MCU's first phase, PaiGi and the production committee also began to draw more elaborate sketches. In fact, until the Incredible Hulk, the Avengers project and MCU were not specific. However, after Marvel was acquired by Disney, Piegie visited Pixar Studios and received a fresh shock. The office wall had a schedule with a detailed plan for the next seven years. Although it was said to have drawn up its own blueprint, it was a much more specialized and sophisticated plan compared to Marvel's project, which was somewhat vague.

                        After the success of the Avengers, PiGi refined the MCU plan in earnest. He considered the most ideal format for a hero movie to be a trilogy. It follows the composition of a typical hero narrative that leads to the birth of a hero, hardship and overcoming, and the completion of a hero. Accordingly, the narrative covering the entire worldview was composed of three phases, and a three-part film dealing with individual heroes was placed in each phase, and all the heroes introduced in each phase were planned to appear and make a team-up film that decorated the finale. It is a structure that expands the worldview with more characters appearing in each phase.
                        
                        The Avengers is a series that clearly shows the difference between Phase 1 and 2. Unlike the Avengers, where the harmony between the characters stood out, the confrontation between the heroes stands out in the second work of the Avengers series, "Age of Ultron. Tony Stark suffers in Iron Man 3 and falls into anxiety that he may not be able to protect anyone. On the other hand, Captain strengthens his belief in people through the Winter Soldier incident. Tony develops Ultron, saying, "We have to prepare for potential threats as we did in the Iron Man series," and Captain opposes it, saying, "It's dangerous to win a war that hasn't even started," as Winter Soldier argued. Their confrontation extends to Phase 3's Captain America: Civil War, which specifically presents the key issues of debate, control and freedom in the MCU worldview.
                        
                        Age of Ultron also served as a bridgehead to seamlessly connect the worldview built up in Marvel's previous works with the sequel to Phase 3. Here, Wakanda, the Black Panther nation, was mentioned for the first time, the Socovia Agreement, the subject of Civil War, was dealt with, and Thor and Hulk provided an opportunity to leave Earth and create a new story. Thanos, the final villain of Infinity Saga, also appears for the first time in the film. And by the time there were concerns that MCU might have become too "maniac" due to the overly serious and complicated Age of Ultron, Marvel neatly finished Phase 2 with a cheerful family comedy about Antman, one of the most undervalued heroes.</p>
