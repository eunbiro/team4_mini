                    <h1>Phase 3: Integration of the story and completion of the MCU</h1>
                    <p>Previously, the characteristic of MCU's worldview was 'reality'. It is definitely a cartoonish imagination, but it gives the impression that it is a situation that would be possible if only a few natural laws were different from now. However, 'Dr. Strange', released as Phase 3's second work, has once again greatly expanded the story's stage by naturally introducing supernatural settings such as magic and soul, cosmic presence, and multiverse into the MCU.

                        The diversity and expansion characteristic of Phase 3 continued. The biggest news for fans is the return of Spider-Man. Although Spider-Man is Marvel's flagship character, Marvel could not make related movies because Sony Pictures permanently owns the rights to the video. However, as the deal was concluded with Sony Pictures in 2015, Spider-Man returned to Marvel's arms as fans wished.
                        On the other hand, as the MCU franchise expanded, the Comics series began to actively contain messages related to the socially disadvantaged. The new hero series, Black Panther, has received great acclaim in the United States for its message on race issues. Pieggy herself has picked Black Panther as her favorite movie. Captain Marvel, which was then released, introduced feminist narratives into MCU, which sparked conflict within the fandom.
                        
                        Phase 3 finished brilliantly with the Avengers' final series, Infinity War and Endgame. The two works drew rave reviews from critics and fans as they wrapped up the "Infinity Saga" spanning 23 long films. Infinity War recalled the double tracks scattered in various works one by one, creating a link with the previous works, while presenting a development that no one expected. On the other hand, Endgame ended its epic with a great deal of praise for MCU's heroes and fans.
                        
                        MCU's strategy of linking several works to each other in Infinity War also resonated greatly. Through 20 films, the original members of the Avengers, Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor, have been at odds and have been building up little by little. In end games, they all shake off their past burdens and recover from wounds. In particular, the conflict between Iron Man and Captain America, which was highlighted in the Captain America series, ended the narrative in a symmetrical manner, leaving a deep lingering impression. Captain, whose life itself was a sacrifice, finally returns to Steve Rogers to find a happy life, and Iron Man, who was immersed in his own self-righteousness, remains Iron Man forever, making heroic sacrifices for everyone.</p>
